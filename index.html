							<h1>Energy Consumption Evaluation Approach for oriented code (2014.4-2015.7)</h1>
							<p>Under the guidance of Associate Professor Jie Song in Northeastern University Cloud Computing Research Institute for the research of the energy consumption of large-scale distributed code, mainly for object-oriented programming of energy consumption, the main content involves the following aspects:</p>
							<p>Tree-structured object-oriented code.</p>
							<p>Research on energy consumption matrix of virtual codes.</p>
							<p>The energy consumption evaluation of structured code.</p>
							<p>Optimization of object-oriented structured code.</p>

							<h1>Design and implementation of water-leak detecting algorithm (2016.12-2017.6)</h1>
							<p>Under the guidance of Dr. Baihua Li in Loughborough University design and implement a water-leak detecting algorithm for a UK company (Quensus Ltd). The algorithm is mainly focus on finding a new strategy to help water companies detect the leakage of their users by using machine learning method, the main content involves the following aspects:</p>
							<p>Analyze and filter the raw data using water.</p>
							<p>Investigate the patterns of users.</p>
							<p>Build a mathematic model by using Matlab.</p>
							<p>Using the machine learning method to train the data.</p>

							<h1>Vehicle number plate recognition System (Neusoft Group Co., Ltd) (2016.6-2016.8)</h1>
							<p>Under the guidance of Lecturer Dandan Guo completed with four teammates. The aim is to design and implement a vehicle number plate recognition system by using traditional computer vision method. The system contains a client end which is responsible for gathering the photo and a sever end which is responsible for processing the data and storing the data into the database. I am responsible for design the algorithm of vehicle number plate detecting, the main content involves the following aspects:</p>
							<p>Locate the number plate into a proper level.</p>
							<p>Find the region of interest.</p>
							<p>Pre-process the picture.</p>
							<p>Detect the features and make a matching.</p>
